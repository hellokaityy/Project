                Hello! My name is Kaity and I'm running for CAB President. I
                have been involved in the Campus Activities Board since I
                arrived on campus freshman year. My CAB involvement started when
                I won both a TV and a $400 Delta Airline voucher at welcome week
                bingo. I became involved in the committees shortly thereafter
                and thus began my CAB career. Learn more about my journey and
                about what I have accomplished in one of the largest
                organizations on campus and about why I want to be president and
                how I can give back to this campus! To read about my mission
                statement and CAB history, click below!

            Since freshman year, I've been committed to CAB and have loved
            putting on events for the Babson Community. I strive to make every
            event the best it can possibly be, and bring a "can-do" attitude to
            everything I do!
