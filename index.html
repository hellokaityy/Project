                Hello! My name is Kaity and I'm running for CAB President. I have
                been involved in the Campus Activities Board since I arrived on
                campus freshman year. My CAB involvement started when I won both a
                TV and a $400 Delta Airline voucher at welcome week bingo. I
                became involved in the committees shortly thereafter and thus
                began my CAB career. Learn more about my journey and about what I
                have accomplished in one of the largest organizations on campus
                and about why I want to be president and how I can give back to
                this campus!
