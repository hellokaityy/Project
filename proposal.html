      <h1>My Project Proposal</h1>
      <h2>Kaity Goodwin</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
      <p>
        My website aims to serve as a portfolio for my involvement on the Campus
        ACtivities Board as well as other event planning experience. I hope to
        showcase some of my event proposals, marketing design and work, etc. to
        serve as a porfolio or personal website in the events field.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
      <p>
        I want to be able to centralize my event and marketing experience and be
        able to link to my resume. I also hope that this website will serve in
        my candidacy for president of CAB when elections begin next semester!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
      <p>
        My target audience would be potential employers or internships where I
        would want to showcase and give a better glimpse into my experience in
        event planning. If it is used as a campaign site in the seccond
        semester, it will also be targeted towards the Babson population, so I
        want to ensure that it is easily navigable and eye catching so that
        people will be interested in my experiences and qualifications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
      <p>
        I plan to include marketing materials and images (portfiol page), a
        biography page about myself and why I enjoy event planning, links to
        some sample outlines and plans for events, photos of events, and
        potentially links to social media with upcoming events for the event
        planning organizations I'm involved in.
